    "text": "What is contained in Advent Hymnals?\nThis is an ambitious project, already spanning more than a year. At the end of it, it should be able to achieve the following:\n\nText for all the songs in all hymnals used by Adventist from Millenial Harp of 1843 all the way to the present one.\nTunes for all of these hymns.\nLinks to renditions of these songs if they exist, or to those sang by singing software if human renditions of the same are not available.\nIdentify and make visible all points where there is an error in any of the songs, such as in Millenial Harp where it says of the second advent Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet. This is part of singing with understanding.\nIdentify all changes that have been introduced in the modern hymnals and the reasons behind those changes.\nAvail all this data in an easy to use mobile phone application.\nAvail also a desktop application for personal use or for projecting in public worship."

Maybe you belong to one of those churches where most people know but a few songs and they never ever want to learn any new one, so that it is the same rounds meeting after meeting. But remember that in your family worship you can sing these. We will continue doing all that we can so as to make learning the songs here so easy that a child uneducated in music can learn them on his own.\nAs you continue singing, you will learn such deep Bible truths that can never be effaced."

Said Peter, Lord, it shall not be;\nThou shalt not stoop to washing me\nOh! that no Christian now may say,\nI cannot Jesus' word obey.\nYe call me Lord and Master too;\nThen do as I have done to you;\nAll my commands and sayings keep,\nAnd show your love by washing feet\n\n4.
